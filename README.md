# Statistical Method Project: Pattern of psychotropic drug consumption

**Summary**
- Identified the variables that could affect the drug consumption.
- Applied both single and multiple linear regression to estimate the relationships between the predictors and responses.

We intend to study at the pattern of psychotropic drug consumption. In terms of Sex (gender), age, mean age, and GHQ (General Health Questionnaire), we are interested in learning which of these variables were the most influential in drug consumption.
We applied both single and multiple linear regression methods to analyze the data.
